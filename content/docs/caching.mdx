We cache all your requests so that you don't have pay for the same request again.

## What counts as a unique screenshot?
A unique screenshot is any combination of url and parameters that you have not requested before.

## How long do we cache?
The maximum TTL for any request is 7 days, so after 7 days your cache screenshot / PDF will be deleted. Maximum CDN bandwidth for cached requests is 10GB/day, you'll need an enterprise plan to upgrade this limit.
