## Custom Paper Size

To capture using custom paper size, you can use the `width` and `height` options. Please note that both are mandatory for setting custom paper size. You can also customise the paper margins using `marginTop`, `marginRight`, `marginBottom` and `marginLeft` options. All four margins must be specified for setting custom margin.
